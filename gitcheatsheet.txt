# You can propose changes (add it to the Index) using
git add <filename>
git add *

# This is the first step in the basic git workflow. To actually commit these changes use:
git commit -m "Commit message"

# Now the file is committed to the HEAD, but not in your remote repository yet.

# Your changes are now in the HEAD of your local working copy. To send those changes to your remote repository, execute 
git push origin master
